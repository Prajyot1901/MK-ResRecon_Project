# MK-ResRecon_Project
Multi-Kernel Residual Framework for Texture-Aware 3D MRI Refinement from Sparse 2D Slices
##For testing the models:
1) Download the code files in the testing folder.
2) Download the model weights from the link
3) Download the data from the link
4) Run 'slicing.py' after changing the paths of input and output directories.
5) Run 'MK-ResRecon_test.py' after changing the input path, saved weights downloaded earlier and the txt file.
6) Run Generate_images recursevily after changing the input directory, output directory, model weights, slice gap and txt file each time.
7) Run 'Reconstruct_3D' after changing the input directory, output directory, txt file and model weights
8) Run 'IdentityRefineNet3D' after changing the Input Directory, Output Directory and Model Weights.
